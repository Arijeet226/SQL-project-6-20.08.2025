This is a project made from SQL using advance queries SQL advance Project Challenge Online Food Delivery App This week organized by DataPencil and Kalyani Bhatnagar ma'am special thanks to all who are associated with it for helping me out throughout this journey and letting me showcase my analytical mindset and sharpen my SQL skill which will form as building blocks of my career journey.
DAY-1-SQL JOINs (across 2 to 4 tables)GROUP BY and HAVING clauses COUNT, SUM, AVG and DISTINCT Sorting and filtering logic
DAY-2- Conditional logic using CASE WHEN Table joins across customer, orders, restaurants Aggregation using COUNT, SUM, GROUP BY, ORDER BY Sorting and filtering logic for clean reports.
DAY-3-Writing inner subqueries inside WHERE, SELECT, and FROM clauses
DAY-4- ROW_NUMBER(), RANK(), DENSE_RANK(),SUM() OVER, AVG() OVER, COUNT() OVER Creating running totals & customer activity trends Partitioning & ordering within window functions.Tracking first/last order, most loyal customers, and daily order value trends
DAY-5-More in depth focus on Windows functions.
DAY-6-We're diving deep into SQL Views – a powerful tool every analyst must master!
DAY-7-We’re diving into SQL Temporary Tables – a smart way to store intermediate results and make multi-step queries easier to manage.
You’ll learn how to create temp tables on the fly, use them for complex transformations, and clean them up once you’re done – just like in real-world analytics projects.
DAY-8- SQL CTEs (Common Table Expressions) Special Define a CTE with WITH cte_name AS (...)Chain multiple CTEs to build logic step‑by‑step
Reuse a CTE within the same query (without rewriting subqueries)
Write beginner-friendly non‑recursive CTEs and get a peek at recursive CTEs for hierarchies & sequences
DAY-9-SQL Joins + CTEs + Aggregation + Ranking Special. Blend data from multiple tables with INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, and RIGHT JOIN
Use CTEs to simplify and layer your business logic Perform advanced aggregation for KPIs like revenue, orders, and customer activity Apply ranking functions like ROW_NUMBER(), RANK(), and DENSE_RANK() to create leaderboards & trends Mix all concepts into single, production-ready SQL reports
DAY-10-the power of automation in SQL using Stored Procedures Create stored procedures for repeatable business logic Pass parameters to filter results dynamically Handle multiple steps inside a single procedure.
Reuse procedures across different reports without rewriting code.
Automate frequent queries like revenue reports, customer searches, and date-based filters.
DAY-11,12-Practicing the previously taught concept.
DAY-13-14- Focuses on creating the visualization of each queries result and a final report carved out of Canva to summarize all the day's work in a single document. It was a fun journey
